## Medical Records
Health care institutions gather and store sensitive information from patients with the goal of
providing the best care possible. The medical history of a patient is essential to allow correct
diagnostic and help the clinical staff act in the shortest time possible. This information is
highly sensitive and must be kept private for the responsible staff only. At the same time, the
medical records should be accessible by any health care institution to ensure that a patient
can be assisted anywhere.
To guarantee data availability, health care institutions in the future might rely on data
repositories accessible through the Internet. This poses a threat, since patient data can be
accessed by unauthorized personnel. It is also extremely difficult to manage access to data
using standard access control mechanisms due to the vast amounts of user, groups and
patients and the constant adjustment in privileges that must be done to maintain patient’s
confidentiality.
In this topic you should define a cloud-based system to store medical records. The records
are available for a wide range of users, so the system must provide an interface to manage
access privileges to the records. Consider using different access control models, like ABAC,
RBAC, and standards, like XACML‡
, that have several open-source implementations.
